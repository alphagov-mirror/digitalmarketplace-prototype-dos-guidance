        Publish your requirements and evaluation criteria
      </h1>

      <p>All requirements are published on the Digital Marketplace where anyone can see them.

</p>

<p>Your requirements will be open for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>If you publish your requirements today (23 April), suppliers will be able to apply until Thursday 7 May 2020 at 11:59pm GMT.

Be aware that timescales set by the Digital Marketplace don’t take into account public holidays, so consider delaying publishing in these cases to maximise the supplier response time and your own availability to answer supplier questions.
</p>

<p>Supplier questions will be sent to:</p>

<p>xyz@email.address</p>

<p>Make sure this email address will be monitored. If you’re away while suppliers can still ask questions, you should make sure your emails are forwarded to a colleague.
</p>

<p>Make sure your colleague has access to your Digital Marketplace account so they can answer questions in your absence.

</p>

<p>Read how to change, withdraw or cancel your requirements.</p>
