        Evaluation weighting

      <p> Use the weightings to say how important each evaluation criteria is.</p>

        Technical competence
      </h2>

      <p>
      Technical competence is how well the supplier can do the work you need
      them to do. It’s also known as ‘technical merit and functional fit’. If a
      supplier has the right skills and experience, a good understanding of
      your requirements, and works in an agile way, they should have the
      technical competence to do the work.
      </p>

        classes: "govuk-input--width-5",
        hint: {
          text: "This can be between 10% and 75%"
        }
      }) }}

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Cultural fit
      </h2>

      <p>
      Cultural fit is how well you and the supplier will work together. If the
      supplier’s values and behaviour are similar to your organisation’s, they
      should be a good cultural fit.
      </p>

      {{ govukInput({
        classes: "govuk-input--width-5",
        hint: {
          text: "This can be between 5% and 20%"

      }) }}

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Price
      </h2>

      <p>Price is evaluated on how close each supplier’s quote is to the cheapest quote.</p>
