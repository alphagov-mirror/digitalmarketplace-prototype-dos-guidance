      <p>Say when you need suppliers to start work.</p>

      <p>Think about the procurement timeline and how long it will take to complete. You will be inviting shortlisted suppliers to provide written proposals and potentially presentations. These will all need to be evaluated, moderated, the contract agreed and signed, and the supplier receive security clearance before work can commence.

</p>

<p>When you shortlist, you can exclude suppliers who canâ€™t start by this date.</p>

<p>eg 31 12 2020</p>
